# Practical Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the project files for the Practical Machine Learning Coursera Course which is part of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization.

**FOR REVIEWERS:** This repo contains a gh-pages branch to view the `project.html` file. You can view it by clicking this link [https://rishabh-joshi.github.io/pml_project/project.html](https://rishabh-joshi.github.io/pml_project/project.html).

The file `project.md` is the markdown file which is generated by running the file `project.Rmd`. **Reviewers should either view the `project.md` file or the `project.html` file using the `gh-pages` branch.**

`pml-training.csv` and `pml-testing.csv` contains the training and testing dataset used in this project.

The directories `project_cache` and `project_files` contains the cached files which will be used for running the `project.Rmd` file. If `project.Rmd` is executed without the presence of the cached files, then the code will take extremely long time to complete.
